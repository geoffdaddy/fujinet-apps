# mastodon

The #FujiNet Mastodon example, done for the TRS-80 Color Computer.

This runs in Disk Extended Color BASIC, and uses the HDB-DOS dwread() and dwwrite() vectors to do the low-level DriveWire communication.

This program is an example of how to query web service end-points for JSON, parse them, and display them.
